(This would mean bunched in a group) Dave's tip: When you have to run single-core cables that are expected to draw some appreciable amount of electric current through a metal ferrous enclosure, you must be aware that the magnetic field that will be created by the a.c. current in the conductors will induce eddy currents into the ferrous material of the enclosure, shown in the image. {{ exam-1-q43.jpg }} These eddy currents, which are electric currents, draw their power from the electric current in the conductors, this means less electric current is available for the load the conductors are supposed to be supplying. Additionally, the eddy currents will cause the ferrous enclosure to start to get warm, and in time possibly hot, so some means must be found to eliminate the eddy currents. Rubber or plastic grommets are electric insulators not magnetic field insulators. No insulation material exists that will block a magnetic field. A magnetic field will go straight through steel, lead, rock, diamond, anything. Are you a bit skeptical about this? Then consider the planet Earth, the Earth's core produces the Earth's magnetic field, this field starts from the centre of the planet, travelling through thousands of miles of magma and solid rock, extending 370,000 miles into space. The only material that can shield a magnetic field is Mu-Metal but even this can't total block a magnetic field. The solution is to cut away the ferrous material where the cables enter the enclosure, and replace it with something that is 'Not Ferrous' such as Brass, or Aluminium. As a non-ferrous material the magnetic field that may circulate in them will be considerably lower than a ferrous material such as Steel also: these materials are conductors, and as such any eddy currents created in them will have low resistance to the flow of electric current, low resistance means virtually no opposition to the flow of eddy currents, hence no heating effect, and no power loss. If a steel enclosure was used, the eddy currents would flow in the steel which is a poor conductor, containing an appreciable amount of resistance, it is this resistance to the flow of eddy currents that causes a ferrous metal enclosure to heat up. So just cut out a portion of the steel enclosure, braze in an Aluminium or Brass plate, and your problem is solved.",""

We find this appendix on page 563, skimming the section we find Power factor correction on (P564) and we are advised improving the load power factor will reduce thermal losses in the wiring tariff penalties",""
